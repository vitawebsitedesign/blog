Even though all companies expect a certain rate of turnover, losing key personnel can disrupt key project outcomes, by the unexpected increase of **project expenditure**.

A company needs to step in to address this *immediately*, before it gets out of control. In fact, they need to do this before employees leave. This is about risk management.

And this management can come through 5 primary actions.

# 1. Everybody loves Benjamin Franklin
When a high-salary employee leaves, often they will be replaced by hiring a lower-salary employee. This frees up [working capital](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/w/workingcapital.asp), which SHOULD be re-invested into retaining existing key personnel & keeping the company's turnover rate stable.

What's that? An important engineer left when capital isn't properly reinvested into the people that actually do work in a company? *Oh no, who would've thought.*

I get that having money sitting in an account is nice to look at, but you gotta actuall use investor capital.

For the love of god - hard-working employees **deserve** at least some improvement in their work life.

# 2. Gotta get them sweet meaningless title promotions!
When an employee with high responsibility leaves, that responsibility should be assigned to an existing employee in the form of a title promotion.

Sometimes a new employee is hired to take on the (now) unassigned responsibilities. Which is fine is the new employee's skill level is high enoguh to enable meeting those reponsibilities.

Unfortunately the *side effect* is that existing employees will feel undervalued. They feel that since they have more time exposure in current & future works, they are more able to take on responsibilities & hence should get a promotion.

This side effect increases the risk of said key personnel leaving due to morale.

# 3. Engineer benchwarmers
Before intensive projects, relevant engineers (optimally) need to be in a good state of mind. This is to minimise the risk of burnout & maximize productivity during the project.

And after, they also need a break. A time to destress, sit on the beach, a "reset" from "my life sucks" to "ah my life isnt so bad".

Good software companies ***provide*** the before, **BUT** often rush into the next project after each project finishes - a never ending flurry of sweaty sprints, nose to the grindstone sessions, & pain.

Excellent software companies do both the "before" AND "after". For instance, Microsoft shipped the initial version of Excel, they gave their engineers a small break to unwind, instead of immediately jumping into the next project.

Not applying both increases turnover risk.

# 4. Going forward in the game
I'm not talking about just plans, because anyone can just write some docx with bullet points.

I'm talkin' about management actively ENFORCING the plan on at least a once-a-fortnight basis. Engineers need to know AND feel that they're actually going forward at the company.

Otherwise one day they'll browse [some random website popular with software engineers](https://stackoverflow.com/jobs) & discover a shiny new company claiming that it has endless cash & that it cures cancer etc.

Applying a career plan **after** the engineer has put in their notice.... isn't exactly going to keep them in the company.

# 5. Happy land!
If a software company hasn't bothered with a decent culture to compete for talent, then that's probably a good first step:
- Allow working from home some days, **at the engineers choice**
- Free food & drinks to make their work lives bearable. This has little effectiveness during BAU work, but during intensive projects that involve overtime/late nights, tasty consumables really do soften the blow.
- Announcing unexpected *pleasing* events: one-off bonuses, merch, ice-cream from a great gelato place
- 10% time so engineers can work on what they actually want to do, with 100% autonomy & NO micromanagement. We talkin' freedom baby!
